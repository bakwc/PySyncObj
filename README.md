PySyncObj is a python library for building fault-tolerant distributed systems. It provides the ability to replicate your application data between multiple servers. It has following features:

- [raft protocol](http://raft.github.io/) for leader election and log replication
- Log compaction - it use fork for copy-on-write while serializing data on disk
- Dynamic membership changes - you can do it with [syncobj_admin](https://github.com/bakwc/PySyncObj/wiki/syncobj_admin) utility or [directly from your code](https://github.com/bakwc/PySyncObj/wiki/Dynamic-membership-change)
- [Zero downtime deploy](https://github.com/bakwc/PySyncObj/wiki/Zero-downtime-deploy) - no need to stop cluster to update nodes
- In-memory and on-disk serialization - you can use in-memory mode for small data and on-disk for big one
- Encryption - you can set password and use it in external network
- Python2 and Python3 on linux, macos and windows - no dependencies required (only optional one, eg. cryptography)
- Configurable event loop - it can works in separate thread with it's own event loop - or you can call onTick function inside your own one
- Convenient interface - you can easily transform arbitrary class into a replicated one (see example below).

## Install
PySyncObj itself:
```bash
pip install pysyncobj
```
Cryptography for encryption (optional):
```bash
pip install cryptography
```

## Usage
Consider you have a class that implements counter:
```python
class MyCounter(object):
	def __init__(self):
		self.__counter = 0

	def incCounter(self):
		self.__counter += 1

	def getCounter(self):
		return self.__counter
```
So, to transform your class into a replicated one:
 - Inherit it from SyncObj
 - Initialize SyncObj with a self address and a list of partner addresses. Eg. if you have `serverA`, `serverB` and `serverC` and want to use 4321 port, you should use self address `serverA:4321` with partners `[serverB:4321, serverC:4321]` for your application, running at `serverA`; self address `serverB:4321` with partners `[serverA:4321, serverC:4321]` for your application at `serverB`; self address `serverC:4321` with partners `[serverA:4321, serverB:4321]` for app at `serverC`.
 - Mark all your methods that modifies your class fields with `@replicated` decorator.
So your final class will looks like:
```python
class MyCounter(SyncObj):
	def __init__(self):
		super(MyCounter, self).__init__('serverA:4321', ['serverB:4321', 'serverC:4321'])
		self.__counter = 0

	@replicated
	def incCounter(self):
		self.__counter += 1

	def getCounter(self):
		return self.__counter
```
And thats all! Now you can call `incCounter` on `serverA`, and check counter value on `serverB` - they will be synchronized.

## Batteries
If you just need some distributed data structures - try built-in "batteries". Few examples:
### Counter & Dict
```python
from pysyncobj import SyncObj
from pysyncobj.batteries import ReplCounter, ReplDict

counter1 = ReplCounter()
counter2 = ReplCounter()
dict1 = ReplDict()
syncObj = SyncObj('serverA:4321', ['serverB:4321', 'serverC:4321'], consumers=[counter1, counter2, dict1])

counter1.set(42, sync=True) # set initial value to 42, 'sync' means that operation is blocking
counter1.add(10, sync=True) # add 10 to counter value
counter2.inc(sync=True) # increment counter value by one
dict1.set('testKey1', 'testValue1', sync=True)
dict1['testKey2'] = 'testValue2' # this is basically the same as previous, but asynchronous (non-blocking)
print(counter1, counter2, dict1['testKey1'], dict1.get('testKey2'))
```
### Lock
```python
from pysyncobj import SyncObj
from pysyncobj.batteries import ReplLockManager

lockManager = ReplLockManager(autoUnlockTime=75) # Lock will be released if connection dropped for more than 75 seconds
syncObj = SyncObj('serverA:4321', ['serverB:4321', 'serverC:4321'], consumers=[lockManager])
if lockManager.tryAcquire('testLockName', sync=True):
  # do some actions
  lockManager.release('testLockName')
```
You can look at [batteries implementation](https://github.com/bakwc/PySyncObj/blob/master/pysyncobj/batteries.py), [examples](https://github.com/bakwc/PySyncObj/tree/master/examples) and [unit-tests](https://github.com/bakwc/PySyncObj/blob/master/test_syncobj.py) for more use-cases. Also there is an [API documentation](http://pysyncobj.readthedocs.io).
